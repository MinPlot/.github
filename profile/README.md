MinPlot is an open-sourced MATLAB®-based mineral formula recalculation and compositional plotting program for electron microprobe analyses (EPMA). MinPlot is a fast and easy to use command line program and requires no prior computer programming knowledge. Percent mass fractions of oxides are loaded from datafiles and the user answers simple prompts to select mineral type, normalization scheme, and plotting options. Recalculated mineral formulas are automatically saved as output files and plots may be further manually customized by the user prior to saving.

Current version (v1.0): The current version is command-lined based and requires a MATLAB® subscription to run. The program offers recalculation and structural formula assignment for 15 different mineral groups: Garnet, pyroxene, olivine, amphibole, feldspar, mica, staurolite, cordierite, chlorite, chloritoid, talc, epidote, titanite, oxyspinel, and sulfides. 

Plans for future updates: A major overhaul is in the works! Version 2.0, planned for the first half of 2023, will include a stand alone app that can be run without a MATLAB® subscription. There will also be a feature for known contents of Fe2O3 and FeO for some Fe-bearing minerals (e.g., via Mössbauer, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, or other technique). A routine for tourmaline will also be added.
